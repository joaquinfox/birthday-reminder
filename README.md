I built this app with create-react-app. I use state hooks to pass data from a static file to state and render it. The app is an exercise in the application of useState, the ES6 import module, the ES6 map function and css styling using css grid and css variables.

The design is inspired by https://uidesigndaily.com/ and is a step in my self guided study of web development.
